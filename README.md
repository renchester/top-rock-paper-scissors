# The Odin Project

## Project: Rock Paper Scissors

**Live version** of the game is [here](https://renchester.github.io/top-rock-paper-scissors/)

This is the very first project that I have created completely from scratch, without any guides whatsoever. For this specific project, the parameters were simple, to implement the mechanics of **rock, paper, scissors** through code and to add a GUI to the game.

### HTML

The page structure has multiple elements including a title page, a modal window for user input, a view of the actual game, and another modal showing the game result. These elements have different classes that get manipulated through DOM and Javascript to display the game.

### CSS

The game employs a simple retro design that fits multiple screen sizes. The rock, paper, and scissors icons all have animations when hovered over to highlight activity. The game is all set within one container and uses several flexboxes to fit the content nicely in different screens.

### Javascript

The functions used in this game is divided into three main parts:
(1) **Initializers** to load up the initial game state and generate the evaluation procedure;
(2) **Display** functions to manipulate the DOM, show and hide elements, and show the game results; and
(3) **Game state** functions to store and keep track of the rounds as well as execute the evaluations;
