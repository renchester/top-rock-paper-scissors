# The Odin Project

## Project: Rock Paper Scissors

**Live version** of the game is [here](https://renchester.github.io/top-rock-paper-scissors/)

This is the very first project that I have created completely from scratch, without any guides whatsoever. For this specific project, the parameters were simple, to implement the mechanics of **rock, paper, scissors** through code and to add a GUI to the game.

### HTML

The HTML structure has multiple elements that have the _hidden_ class at first which will be removed once the game has been initialized. One example of this is the modal window.

### CSS

For this project, I used multiple flexboxes as I find that to be easier than other layouts. I also studied some hover and focus effects that help add emphasis to different elements in the page.

### Javascript

I solidified my foundation on Javascript with this project. Using multiple event delegations, I was able to implement the different CSS effects that I planned to do. I was also able to research further on DOM manipulation and to identify the available properties and methods through prototypal inheritance using the console.

### Design

I utilized a simple retro theme in the UI with the button design and Google fonts. The page is fully responsive and should work on multiple devices and on different viewport sizes.
